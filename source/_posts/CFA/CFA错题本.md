<details><summary>答案</summary>
Solution B
A. Incorrect. The required rate of return is the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accept an investment. The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes net present value equal to zero.
B. Correct. The required rate of return is the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accept an investment.
C. Incorrect. The required rate of return is the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accept an investment.
