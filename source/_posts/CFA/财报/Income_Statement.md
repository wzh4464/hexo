## Relationship with other financial statements

SCI = IS + OCI

- SCI: Statement of Comprehensive Income

- COGS: Cost of Goods Sold
- Gross Profit = Rev - COGS
- period cost/expenses
  - Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)
  - Research and Development (R&D)
  - Depreciation and Amortization
  - ...
- Operating Profit = Gross Profit - period cost/expenses = PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) (考试时等同)
- Interest Expense
- Profit Before Tax = Operating Profit - Interest Expense

  - By nature
  - By function

>
> - By nature:
>   - standalone depreciation expense
> - By function: (the cost of sales method)
>   - Production: included in COGS
>   - Administration: included in Period Cost

## Gain/Loss

- Gain/Loss on sale of PPE(PPE: Property, Plant and Equipment, 不动产、厂房设备等)

> Remark: PBIT includes non-recurring gains and losses, while operating income does not.

## Net Income

<!-- - $Net\ Income = (Revenue - ordinary\ expenses) + (Gains - Losses) + (other\ income - other\ expenses)$ -->
- $ \text{Net Income} = \text{Revenue} - \text{ordinary expenses} + \text{Gains} - \text{Losses} + \text{other income} - \text{other expenses} $

  - there is reasonable certainty as to the collectibility of the asset to be received (cash or receivable)
